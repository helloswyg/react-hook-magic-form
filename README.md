<br />


**DONE:**
- Pass classes for form, input, etc.
- Fix issues with refs (ref arrays).
- Create input adapter for native elements.

<br />


**TODO:**

- Create additional interfaces for controls and display boxes (Buttons, FeedbackBox, Watch...).

- Pass custom error and buttons components.

- Implement combo input.

- Configurable onChange callback trigger (blur, change, throttle, etc.) by input type.

- Review reset / re-init functionality.

- Document autoloading states, etc.

- Move some of the base input types here.

- Tests & stories with example components.

<br />


**Maybe Later:**

- Decorator components can be configured and added automatically too (could be useful with native inputs).

- TSDocs.

- Pass components and config too?

- Make forms reusable inside other forms.
